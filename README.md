<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify">The ability to communicate effectively across linguistic divides has become essential in today's highly interconnected society. Our main objective is to create a user-focused platform that precisely records user interactions and translates material with ease. Our goal is to provide a scalable, effective solution that meets a range of language translation requirements. Furthermore, by using recent search data, we hope to improve user experience and guarantee a more seamless and customized interaction path.</p>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p align="justify">An easy-to-use web platform called "MY-Translator-Hub" was developed to expedite language translation assignments and maintain an extensive record of user communications. By allowing users to input text, it makes use of the Azure AI Translator service's capabilities to provide accurate and contextually appropriate translations. In addition, the app has a handy function that displays the results of recent searches, making it simple for users to go back and utilize their earlier translations.

"Celebrate Global Connectivity: Our AI Translator Website enables effortless connection internationally by seamlessly bridging languages. Utilizing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technology, it enables users to overcome language boundaries and embrace a global community."
